They ask questions even parents don't know or are tired of answering.</p><p>This is where the Nabi Tablet comes in. When a parent doesn't know the answers or are overwhelmed by a child's questions, they can give them the Nabi Tablet. This will answer all their questions while also giving parents a break.</p>",
